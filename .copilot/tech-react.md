# React Standard (Vite/SPA)

- **Patterns:** Functional Components with Hooks.
- **State:** Use `React Query` for server state and Context API for components state if needed.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
- **UI Components:** Core components are shared for 2 aplikacions. Components are located in `../packages/ui`. We are using atomic desing combine with shadcn + tailwind. If possible use generic components from here.
- **Props:** Use TypeScript `type` for all props. Don't use React.FC or Function Component props
